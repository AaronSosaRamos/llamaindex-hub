Description of Business and Basis of PresentationOrganization and Description of BusinessLyft,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  with  its  headquarters  in  San  Francisco,  California.  The  Company  operates  multimodaltransportation  networks  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  offer  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  through  the  Company’s  platform  and  mobile-basedapplications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle withriders  who  need  a  ride.  The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  atransportation network company (“TNC”).Transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connectsdrivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter intoshort-term  rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  Lyft  Rentals,  aconsumer offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders canrequest auto maintenance and collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) andinclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

For  foreign  subsidiaries  where  the  U.S.  dollar  is  thefunctional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For theforeign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to aseparate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.Initial Public OfferingThe  Company’s  registration  statement  on  Form  S-1  (the  “IPO  Registration  Statement”)  related  to  its  initial  public  offering  (“IPO”)  was  declared  effective  onMarch  28,  2019,  and  the  Company’s  Class  A  common  stock  began  trading  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  on  March  29,  2019.

(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connectsconsumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(“Eaters”)  with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with delivery  service  providers  (“Couriers”)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  –  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions whichmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5110, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8585459161396961)], metadata={'5349289b-30f5-462f-8817-8e4a5b33a52b': {'page_label': '53', 'file_name': 'uber_2021.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/10k/uber_2021.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1880483, 'creation_date': '2024-12-17', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-17'}, '731f72df-c1c4-4c91-8777-ab42c90b6857': {'page_label': '77', 'file_name': 'uber_2021.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/10k/uber_2021.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1880483, 'creation_date': '2024-12-17', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-17'}, 'b7f3c73b-3b14-44f7-8ef7-6e8273e214d7': {'page_label': '84', 'file_name': 'uber_2021.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/10k/uber_2021.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1880483, 'creation_date': '2024-12-17', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-17'}}), is_error=False)], source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5349289b-30f5-462f-8817-8e4a5b33a52b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '53', 'file_name': 'uber_2021.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/10k/uber_2021.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1880483, 'creation_date': '2024-12-17', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-17'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='57764132-fb6e-4014-83ba-89bcee5d02f3', node_type='4', metadata={'page_label': '53', 'file_name': 'uber_2021.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/10k/uber_2021.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1880483, 'creation_date': '2024-12-17', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-17'}, hash='6c67081fe089cde92cfa7607afe956a0ac98bbebf2dad8bfeb4004bcdf6557c3')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Financial and Operational Highlights\\nYear Ended December 31, Constant Currency (In millions, except percentages)2020 2021 2020 to 2021 %Change2020 to 2021 % Change Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) 93 11827 %Trips 5,025 6,368 27 %Gross Bookings $ 57,897 $90,415 56 %53 %Revenue$ 11,139 $17,455 57 %54 %Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (6,768)$(496)93 %Mobility Adjusted EBITDA$ 1,169 $1,596 37 %Delivery Adjusted EBITDA$ (873)$(348)60 %Adjusted EBITDA $ (2,528)$(774)69 % See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAPfinancial measure.

(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connectsconsumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(“Eaters”)  with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with delivery  service  providers  (“Couriers”)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  –  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions whichmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5110, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8585459161396961)], is_dummy_stream=False, metadata=None)"
