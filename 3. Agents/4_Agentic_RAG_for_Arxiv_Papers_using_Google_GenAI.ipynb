        "# Building an LLM Agent to Find Relevant Research Papers from Arxiv\n",
        "Updated by: Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos\n",
        "Credits to: Andrei Chernov.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will create an LLM agent based on the **Google Generative AI** language model. The agent's primary purpose will be to find and summarize research papers from **Arxiv** that are relevant to the user's query. To build the agent, we will use the **LlamaIndex** framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools Used by the Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent will utilize the following three tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **RAG Query Engine**\n",
        "   This tool will store and retrieve recent papers from Arxiv, serving as a knowledge base for efficient and quick access to relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Paper Fetch Tool**\n",
        "   If the user specifies a topic that is not covered in the RAG Query Engine, this tool will fetch recent papers on the specified topic directly from Arxiv.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **PDF Download Tool**\n",
        "   This tool allows the agent to download a research paper's PDF file locally using a link provided by Arxiv."

Goal: In this work we present MiniGPT-Pancreas, a Multimodal Large\\nLanguage Model (MLLM), as an interactive chatbot to support clinicians in\\npancreas cancer diagnosis by integrating visual and textual information.\\nMethods: MiniGPT-v2, a general-purpose MLLM, was fine-tuned in a cascaded way\\nfor pancreas detection, tumor classification, and tumor detection with\\nmultimodal prompts combining questions and computed tomography scans from the\\nNational Institute of Health (NIH), and Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)\\ndatasets. The AbdomenCT-1k dataset was used to detect the liver, spleen,\\nkidney, and pancreas. Results: MiniGPT-Pancreas achieved an Intersection over\\nUnion (IoU) of 0.595 and 0.550 for the detection of pancreas on NIH and MSD\\ndatasets, respectively. For the pancreas cancer classification task on the MSD\\ndataset, accuracy, precision, and recall were 0.876, 0.874, and 0.878,\\nrespectively. When evaluating MiniGPT-Pancreas on the AbdomenCT-1k dataset for\\nmulti-organ detection, the IoU was 0.8399 for the liver, 0.722 for the kidney,\\n0.705 for the spleen, and 0.497 for the pancreas. For the pancreas tumor\\ndetection task, the IoU score was 0.168 on the MSD dataset.

A\\npromising solution is the self-evolution strategy, where models are iteratively\\ntrained on data they generate.

To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal self-evolution\\nframework that enables the model to autonomously generate high-quality\\nquestions and answers using only unannotated images.\\n  First, we implement an image-driven self-questioning mechanism, allowing the\\nmodel to create and evaluate questions based on image content, regenerating\\nthem if they are irrelevant or unanswerable. This sets a strong foundation for\\nanswer generation. Second, we introduce an answer self-enhancement technique,\\nstarting with image captioning to improve answer quality. We also use corrupted\\nimages to generate rejected answers, forming distinct preference pairs for\\noptimization. Finally, we incorporate an image content alignment loss function\\nalongside Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss to reduce hallucinations,\\nensuring the model focuses on image content.\\n  Experiments show that our framework performs competitively with methods using\\nexternal information, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to MLLMs.', 'published': datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 20, 8, 6, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'journal_ref': None, 'doi': None, 'primary_category': 'cs.LG', 'categories': ['cs.LG'], 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15650v1', 'arxiv_url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15650v1'}, {'title': 'QUART-Online: Latency-Free Large Multimodal Language Model for Quadruped Robot Learning', 'authors': ['Xinyang Tong', 'Pengxiang Ding', 'Donglin Wang', 'Wenjie Zhang', 'Can Cui', 'Mingyang Sun', 'Yiguo Fan', 'Han Zhao', 'Hongyin Zhang', 'Yonghao Dang', 'Siteng Huang', 'Shangke Lyu'], 'summary': 'This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated\\nwith deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped\\nvision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks.

Due to the high number of design\\nvariables and constraints, these challenges are typically addressed using\\ngradient-based optimisation methods to maintain efficiency. However, this\\napproach often results in a local solution, overlooking the global design\\nspace. Moreover, gradients are frequently unavailable. Bayesian Optimisation\\npresents a promising alternative, enabling sample-efficient global optimisation\\nthrough probabilistic surrogate models that do not depend on gradients.\\nAlthough Bayesian Optimisation has shown its effectiveness for problems with a\\nsmall number of design variables, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional\\nproblems, particularly when incorporating large-scale constraints. This\\nchallenge is especially pronounced in aeroelastic tailoring, where directional\\nstiffness properties are integrated into the structural design to manage\\naeroelastic deformations and enhance both aerodynamic and structural\\nperformance. Ensuring the safe operation of the system requires simultaneously\\naddressing constraints from various analysis disciplines, making global design\\nspace exploration even more complex. This study seeks to address this issue by\\nemploying high-dimensional Bayesian Optimisation combined with a dimensionality\\nreduction technique to tackle the optimisation challenges in aeroelastic\\ntailoring.

We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model\\nthe interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$,\\nand $f\\\\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts.\\nSubsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing\\n$D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\\\\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by\\nthe SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\\\\Lambda$CDM model, we\\nobtain constraints on model parameters $\\\\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\\\\sigma_{8}$\\nand $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates\\nredshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\\\\Omega_m$, $\\\\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\\\\Lambda$CDM\\nmodel.
